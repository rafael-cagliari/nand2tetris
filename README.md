This repository contains my implementations for the first six projects of the **Nand2Tetris** course, based on the book _"The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles"_ by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken.

### Included Projects

1. **Boolean Logic**: Designing basic logic gates using only NAND gates.
2. **Boolean Arithmetic**: Building arithmetic logic, including an ALU (arithmetic logic unit).
3. **Sequential Logic**: Creating memory elements such as flip-flops and RAM.
4. **Machine Language**: Understanding and implementing a simple assembly language.
5. **Computer Architecture**: Building the Hack computer, integrating CPU and memory.
6. **Assembler**: Writing a Kotlin program to translate assembly code into machine code.
